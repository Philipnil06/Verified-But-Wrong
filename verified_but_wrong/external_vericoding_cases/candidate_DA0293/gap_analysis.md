# Gap Analysis: DA0293

Status: **candidate only, not validated**.

Source: `apps` / `apps_test_1430`
Category: `trivial_postcondition`
Confidence: `high`

## Suspected missing requirement

semantic correctness condition

## Why the formal spec may be weak

formal postcondition appears to contain only weak result/range/shape constraints; spec appears trivial or shape/range-only

## Candidate bad implementation idea

return 0 or 1 regardless of the input

## NL excerpt

```text
Given a binary string S of length N and an integer K, find the maximum length of consecutive '1's achievable using at most K flip operations. Each flip operation chooses a contiguous range and flips all bits in that range (0→1, 1→0).
```

## Formal spec excerpt

```dafny
predicate ValidInput(N: int, K: int, S: string) { N > 0 && K >= 0 && |S| == N && forall i :: 0 <= i < |S| ==> S[i] == '0' || S[i] == '1' } function StringToBits(S: string): seq<int> requires forall i :: 0 <= i < |S| ==> S[i] == '0' || S[i] == '1' { seq(|S|, i requires 0 <= i < |S| => if S[i] == '0' then 0 else 1) } predicate ValidResult(result: int, N: int) { 0 <= result <= N } method solve(N: int, K: int, S: string) returns (result: int) requires ValidInput(N, K, S) ensures ValidResult(result, N)
```

## Required manual work

A human must inspect the full external task, write a task-specific weak-spec proxy or document the exact proxy, write an intended oracle over selected inputs, and then create manual_validation.json with status validated or rejected.

Caveat: this is an adapted target-validity demonstration candidate, not a benchmark bug claim.
