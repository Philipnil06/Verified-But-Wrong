# Gap Analysis: DA0244

Status: **candidate only, not validated**.

Confidence: `high`

## Suspected missing requirement

semantic correctness condition

## Why the formal spec may be weak

formal postcondition appears to contain only weak result/range/shape constraints; spec appears trivial or shape/range-only

## Candidate bad implementation idea

return 0 or 1 regardless of the input

## NL excerpt

```text
Given n consecutive days of river observations where on day i there are m_i marks strictly above the current water level, find the minimum possible sum of d_i over all n days, where d_i is the number of marks strictly below the water level on day i. Each day a mark is made at the current water level, marks never wash away, and the total number of marks can only stay the same or increase each day.
```

## Formal spec excerpt

```dafny
predicate ValidInput(n: int, m: seq<int>) { n > 0 && |m| == n && forall i :: 0 <= i < n ==> 0 <= m[i] < i + 1 } predicate ValidSolution(n: int, m: seq<int>, dm: seq<int>) { |dm| == n && |m| == n && (forall i :: 0 <= i < n ==> dm[i] >= m[i] + 1) && (forall i :: 0 <= i < n - 1 ==> dm[i] <= dm[i + 1]) } function SumBelow(m: seq<int>, dm: seq<int>): int requires |m| == |dm| { if |m| == 0 then 0 else (dm[0] - 1 - m[0]) + SumBelow(m[1..], dm[1..]) } method solve(n: int, m: seq<int>) returns (result: int) requires ValidInput(n, m) ensures result >= 0
```

## Required manual work

A human must inspect the full external task, write a task-specific weak-spec proxy or document the exact proxy, write an intended oracle over selected inputs, and then create manual_validation.json with status validated or rejected.

Caveat: this is an adapted target-validity demonstration candidate, not a benchmark bug claim.
