# Gap Analysis: DA0258

Status: **candidate only, not validated**.

Confidence: `high`

## Suspected missing requirement

semantic correctness condition

## Why the formal spec may be weak

formal postcondition appears to contain only weak result/range/shape constraints; spec appears trivial or shape/range-only

## Candidate bad implementation idea

return a range/shape-valid but semantically wrong value

## NL excerpt

```text
Given a fence with n planks of heights, find k consecutive planks with the minimum sum of heights. Return the 1-indexed starting position of such a sequence. If multiple solutions exist, return any valid one.
```

## Formal spec excerpt

```dafny
function sum_window(heights: seq<int>, start: int, k: int): int requires 0 <= start requires start + k <= |heights| requires k > 0 decreases k { if k == 1 then heights[start] else heights[start] + sum_window(heights, start + 1, k - 1) } predicate ValidInput(n: int, k: int, heights: seq<int>) { 1 <= k <= n && |heights| == n && forall i :: 0 <= i < n ==> 1 <= heights[i] <= 100 } predicate ValidResult(result: int, n: int, k: int, heights: seq<int>) requires ValidInput(n, k, heights) { 1 <= result <= n-k+1 && forall start :: 0 <= start <= n-k ==> sum_window(heights, result-1, k) <= sum_window(heights, start, k) && forall start :: 0 <= start < result-1 ==> sum_window(heights, start, k) > sum_window(heights, result-1, k) } method solve(n: int, k: int, heights: seq<int>) returns (result: int) requires ValidInput(n, k, heights) ensures ValidResult(result, n, k, heights)
```

## Required manual work

A human must inspect the full external task, write a task-specific weak-spec proxy or document the exact proxy, write an intended oracle over selected inputs, and then create manual_validation.json with status validated or rejected.

Caveat: this is an adapted target-validity demonstration candidate, not a benchmark bug claim.
